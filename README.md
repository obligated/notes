# notes

I loved VC! The green and red lines showing all my fixes and past mistakes in a glance! Oh how I crave such diffs!

Unforunately, there doesn't exist an easy diff tool for writing, but plenty for code. Places like Google Drive, Draft do provide some sort of version control, but make it difficult to link it back.

As a result, I have decided to use the cheap and easy knockoff, Github, as my diff repo. `Hashtag` AWESOME!

Each diff should be under the appropriate subject file. It's easy to find, cos it's either:
1. Japanese
2. English
3. Chem / Maths

So...not really that hard to find.

For those license nerds, this stuff is off limits. Like, copypasta is not allowed without explicit permission from me. Cos, I'm a tightarse :) Have a nice day
